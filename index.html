         If you've walked through downtown Lafayette recently, you may have noticed some festive window displays popping up in the holiday spirit. Among them is a striking piece of art at Sola Violins—one that’s not painted, but crafted entirely from paper. What makes this artwork even more special is its deep, personal connection to the Lafayette music community.

         Sam Wrobel, the artist behind the creation, says the piece honors the memory of two beloved local musicians who are no longer with us: Chris Stafford, who tragically passed away in a car crash in May, and fiddler Courtney Granger, who died in 2021.

<h2>Business owner hosts 32nd Annual Thanksgiving Luncheon for families in need</h2>
<p>

This Thanksgiving, you have an opportunity to make a difference by volunteering at the 32nd Annual Thanksgiving Luncheon, hosted at Bailey’s Tandoori Grill and Ema’s Café.
Owner Ema Haq, who started the event 32 years ago, is calling on community members to lend a hand with food deliveries for this heartfelt tradition.
Ema first launched the luncheon as a way to give back for the kindness he received when he arrived in Lafayette as a college student from Bangladesh.
"People were very kind to me when I first came," said Haq. "In ’83, I didn’t know what Thanksgiving was. So, when someone invited me to their family’s meal, it meant a lot even though I didn’t know what Thanksgiving was. Just to share a meal on that special day was something I will never forget."
What started as a small gesture of thanks has grown into an annual tradition that now serves thousands of people each year.
"It’s been very humbling and rewarding to see people enjoy the meals we provide. They come and enjoy it just like a full-service restaurant experience," said Haq.

    Haq continues the tradition by offering free meals from his restaurants, Bailey’s Tandoori Grill and Ema’s Café.
The event provides a full dining experience for anyone in need—whether they choose to dine in or take their meal to go. Organizers will also provide limited deliveries for those who are unable to attend due to physical disabilities.
