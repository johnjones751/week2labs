        The Detroit Lions have been dominant for much of the season, leading the
        league in point differential after routinely routing opponents. Against
        Chicago, the Lions were good enough to extend their winning streak to 10
        games. Barely. Jared Goff threw two touchdown passes to Sam LaPorta,
        Jake Bates made three field goals in the first half and Detroit held off
        the Bears 23-20 on Thursday. “It was a crazy ending, right?” Goff asked.
        Indeed. The Bears had the ball in Lions territory late in the game with
        a chance to drive for a game-tying field goal or go-ahead touchdown, but
        they blew the opportunity. Caleb Williams threw an incomplete pass as
        time expired from the Detroit 41 after being sacked with about 30
        seconds left, allowing time to run off the clock even though Chicago had
        one more timeout.“</p>

        I’m focused on getting everyone back and getting
        everyone lined up," Williams said. "I don’t have a microphone, so there
        is no communication with coach there. We could have taken a timeout, but
        if we hit that play, no one would be worried about it.” The NFC-leading
        Lions (11-1) have their best record after 12 games in team history and
        their 10-game winning streak ties a franchise record with the 1934
        squad. The Bears (4-8) have lost six straight, including four by a total
        of 10 points. Chicago coach Matt Eberflus dropped to 5-17 in games
        decided by seven or fewer points, winning 22.7% of those games to rank
        221st and last among coaches with at least 20 games that close. “We're
        right there,” he said. Detroit led 16-0 at halftime and 23-7 after three
        quarters and Williams led a comeback that came up short for the second
        straight week. Williams helped the Bears rally from an 11-point deficit
        in the final 22 seconds of regulation against Minnesota before losing in
        overtime. Detroit opened the game with four straight scoring drives,
        going ahead 16-0 on Goff's 3-yard touchdown pass to LaPorta in the
        second quarter and Bates' field goals. Chicago, meanwhile, failed to
        pick up a first down on its first four drives and gained a total of 32
        yards on those possessions. “We started off pretty hot offensively and
        defensively,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said. Goff's second touchdown
        pass to LaPorta, a 1-yard toss, gave Detroit a 23-7 lead late in the
        third quarter. The score was set up by Jameson Williams' 15-yard
        reverse, which included him hurdling Kevin Byard to gain several extra
        yards. Caleb Williams, the No. 1 pick overall in the draft, was 20 of 39
        for 256 yards with two touchdown passes to Keenan Allen and one to DJ
        Moore. Williams seemed to make his first rookie mistake of the game in
        the third quarter on a run, pulling up instead of going out of bounds
        and took a low hit from linebacker Jack Campbell. “Knee is fine, but
        that play was kind of funky," Williams said. “I didn’t appreciate him
        diving right at my knee, but it is good.”

        The former USC star shook it
        off and on the next snap, threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Allen.
        William connected with Allen for another score, throwing a 9-yarder to
        him with 5:36 remaining. Detroit had a chance to add to its cushion, but
        Bates missed a 45-yard kick after starting his NFL career 19 of 19 on
        field goals on a drive that was stunted by Jameson Williams' 15-yard
        penalty for tossing the football at a Bears player on the sideline.
        Jameson Williams, unsolicited, apologized to the team after the game.
        “I'm proud of him, the way he handled it,” Goff said. Finally, feeling
        festive The Lions snapped a seven-game losing streak on Thanksgiving.
        “We’re going to enjoy this,” Campbell said.
